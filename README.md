  "In this challenge, BNP Paribas Cardif is providing an anonymized database with two categories of claims:
  
  1) Claims for which approval could be accelerated leading to faster payments

  2) Claims for which additional information is required before approval

  Kagglers are challenged to predict the category of a claim based on features available early in the process, helping BNP Paribas Cardif accelerate its claims process and therefore provide a better service to its customers."
